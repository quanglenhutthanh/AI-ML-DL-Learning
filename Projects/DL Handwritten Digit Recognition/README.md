# Introduction

**MNIST** dataset (Modified National Institue of Standards and Technology) is a widely used dataset for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms, particularly in the field of image recognition. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digit from 0-9, along with their corresponding labels (the digit the represent). The dataset is often used as a benchmark for testing image classification models.

In this project, We will train a neural network model based on MNIST dataset and use that model to create an application that can predict handwritten digits.

We will develop two types of model: one is simple neural network consisting only of fully connected layers, and the other is a more complex model that incorporates convolutional layers (CNNs). We also use Gradio to create an user interface, that allows drawing a digit for testing the trained model.
