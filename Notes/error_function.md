# Error Function

The **error function** is used to measure the difference between predicted value of a model and actual value (true value).

The error function give the model feedback on how good or bad its predictions are, so that it can adjusts its parameters (weights and biases) to improve.

## Popular Error Function
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Cross-Entropy Loss (Log Loss)
- Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (NLLL)

# Loss Value

Loss value is the output or result of error function for a single training.

- High loss: Indicates that the model's predictions are far from true values, suggesting poor performance.
- Low Loss: Indicates that the model's predictions are close to true values, suggesting better performance

*The model aims to minimize loss value during training by updating its parameters.*
