# Introduction
## AI, ML and DL

# Machine Learning
## Supervised learning
### Classification vs Regression
### Common Algorithms
#### Classification:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Na√Øve Bayes
#### Regression:
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared

## Unsupervised learning
### Clustering:
- k-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
### Dimensionality Reduction:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE
- UMAP
